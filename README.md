Originally this was just a place to host my assembly practice project but I decided to make it interesting by including notes about the basics of C programming and x86 assembly. They won't teach you every single thing about the languages but it should help you get started there are references to Java since the assumption the people reading these have taken a programming class in Java. In addtion the assembly taught here is the x86_64 intel assembly

#Update Dead repo will probably work on it again someday maybe not
